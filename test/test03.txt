Opposing NFC West running backs beware. The three-time All-Pro and two-time Pro Bowler returned to the field this offseason after missing all of 2014 with an ACL tear in his left knee. Bowman mixed in during Organized Team Activities and minicamps; he looked very confident on the field. Bowman was also able to diagnose plays and showcase his one-of-a-kind instincts. Now it's time to see what Bowman can do when the pads come on in camp.

Before he was allowed to work with Jim Tomsula's new coaching staff, the 49ers starting signal-caller went to Arizona to train. In doing so, Kaepernick picked the brain of Super Bowl MVP quarterback Kurt Warner before taking part in San Francisco's nine-week offseason program. There, new quarterbacks coach Steve Logan was able to share his vast knowledge with the fifth-year pro. Kaepernick will also continue his working relationship with Geep Chryst, who was promoted from QB coach to offensive coordinator. Kaepernick's throwing motion appeared quicker. His decision-making was also on-point. We'll see Kap's next strides when he faces the Bowman-led first-team defense in camp.

Speaking of new coaches, two of the most prominent hires happen to be experienced coordinators. Chryst will lead the offensive side of the ball. The former positon coach served as the San Diego Chargers OC from 1999-00. He also worked with Anquan Boldin (second-round pick in 2003) when he was the quarterbacks coach of the Arizona Cardinals from 2001-03. Both Boldin and Kaepernick have gone on record as saying Chryst has a creative mind and the ability to lead the 49ers offense to success. Under Chryst's watch, San Francisco ran an up-tempo offense in offseason practices. The playbook and play calls have been slimmed down to help the offense be more proactive in reacting to opposing defenses.

As for Manigini, the two-time NFL head coach with the New York Jets and Cleveland Browns, returns to his defensive roots after spending two seasons with the 49ers as an assistant coach on the offensive side of the ball. Mangini won a Super Bowl as a defensive backs coach with the New England Patriots and was later promoted to coordinator under coach Bill Belichick. Now, Mangini's defensive creativity has been applauded by his San Francisco pupils. Several standouts like Bowman and Pro Bowl safety Antoine Bethea have praised his new ideas in what could very well be an attack-first defense in 2015.

The 49ers picked up the final year on Smith's five-year rookie contract. After serving a nine-game suspension in 2014, Smith has vowed to bounce back in a major way in his fifth season in the Bay Area. Smith has continued to build on his relationship with soon-to-be Hall of Fame defensive end Charles Haley. With that relationship, Smith has picked up a few pass-rushing tips. The edge-rusher in Mangini's 3-4 scheme has told the media that he's in the best shape of his life. That's great for a pass-rushing unit that could benefit from the franchise's single-season sack leader. Smith wants to have a big year in 2015. That bodes well for the 49ers.

Free agency began with a big splash in the passing game for San Francisco. Fifth-year pro Torrey Smith left the Baltimore Ravens and signed a five-year contract to boost his new team's vertical passing attack. Smith, who has a career average of 16.9 yards per reception, instantly bonded with Kaepernick in OTAs and minicamp sessions. Smith, however, is not just a one-trick pony. The 6-foot, 205-pound wideout ran crisp underneath routes and looks to be a solid compliment to Boldin, his former teammate with the Ravens.
