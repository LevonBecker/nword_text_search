It's almost impossible to quantify what Russell Wilson's monetary worth is, vis a vis the Seattle Seahawks' salary cap. And that has stopped absolutely nobody from debating it.

With every figure that is tossed out there's a debate. People enjoy discussing it nearly as much as they like arguing about deflated footballs. The latest number is about $21 million per year, which Pro Football Talk said Wilson was offered and didn't accept. That leads to more parsing of the figures with arbitrary numbers: I think he's just worth $18 million, $19 million is a little high and I'd never go to $21 million! It turns into a game show.

There's a soft deadline of July 30, NFL Network said, after which negotiations will stop and Wilson will go on his way and play for about $1.5 million this year. That's a meaningless deadline, because if the Seahawks offered Wilson $25 million a year on July 31 I'm sure he wouldn't point to the deadline and turn it down. But it gives some made-up urgency to the matter.

So let's play along. How much is Wilson worth? It's complicated because you can make the argument he's not the foundation of the Seahawks' success (that's the defense) and he's not the MVP of the offense (Marshawn Lynch). He's a very good player but the Seahawks don't live and die with him. He was terrible for most of the NFC championship game, and the Seahawks won that game. His first completion in the Super Bowl against the Patriots came with about 5:30 left in the second quarter, and the Seahawks were 1 yard from winning that game. If Aaron Rodgers plays that poorly, the Green Bay Packers don't stand a chance (insert a few other quarterback/team combinations in that sentence, if you wish).

But Wilson shouldn't be downgraded simply because he attempts just 26 passes per game in his career or that he was drafted to a great team. Wilson's career passer rating of 98.6 would be second in NFL history to Rodgers if he had the 1,500 career attempts to qualify. That doesn't include 1,877 rushing yards. He has been a very good player.
